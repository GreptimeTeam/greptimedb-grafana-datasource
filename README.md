This is a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana) data source plugin built for
[GreptimeDB](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb). This plugin is built
on top of original Grafana Prometheus data source and enhanced for GreptimeDB's
additional features.

## Screenshots

## Quick Preview using Docker

We built a docker compose file that integrated GreptimeDB, Prometheus,
Prometheus Node Exporter, Grafana and this plugin together.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb-grafana-datasource.git
cd docker
docker compose up
```

You can also try out this plugin from a Grafana docker image:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name=grafana --rm \
  -e "GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb-grafana-datasource/releases/latest/download/info8fcc-greptimedb-datasource.zip;info8fcc" \
